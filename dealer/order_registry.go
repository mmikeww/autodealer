// This code begins by atomically reading the length property.

// Why are we doing this? If we attempted to change an exported field, we might wind up with a scenario in which both the outer and inner loops attempting
// to modify and access the length property at the same time affect the same variable.

// OrderRegistry struct that stores two things: The amount of orders in it and the key.
// It has a single `int` property that represents the amount of orders currently in the registry.
// The `int` property is an atomic.Int, which is part of the golang's atomic package.
// It contains the modification of this `int`property that happens at the same time. The modification of an int cannot happen at two places in code in parallel. This provides a safe way to get or update integers from multiple routines, or from goroutines. In this case itâ€™s the inner length field.
