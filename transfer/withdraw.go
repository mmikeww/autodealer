// ExchangeWithdrawResponse is a struct that is designed to represent the response from the ExchangesWithdrawals API call. ExchangesWithdrawals is a simple function which returns deposit, withdraw, trade and withdrawal information so we will only add the information there which we are interested in:
// ExchangesResponse is a struct that includes information about the request as well as the response, we're only interested in the response hence why we've added resp.
// We've used the Withdrawal struct as that is the response from the exchange (withdraw.ExchangeResponse). The Exchange key is the exchange used to make the request.
// The Type key represents the type of information requested in the Call function. The DestinationAddress is the address the withdrawal was sent to if the request used the DepositAddress field.
// The Time key is when the request was made and the Err field returns errors if any occurred.

// It first creates an exchange manager by name which will fetch the exchange name from the engine.
// This function will fetch the exchange details from the exchange name and returns the balance of an asset for a user.
// Next it creates the WithdrawManager for a given exchange, tries to withdraw the crypto asset, and gets the destination address. This is done by calling the withdraw crypto trade function
// so here's the thing  this function returns an Exchange response which holds the deposit id  on that exchange.
// Finally, we update the results which we return in JSON format.
// After we make sure that the withdrawal functionality is working we can inject the functionality in the withdrawal method of the engine struct.
