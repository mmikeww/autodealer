// Strategy is an interface and defines all function needed for a user defined strategy. The RootStrategy provides a way to create and

// Strategy interface defines all the functions that must be implemented in order for the strategy to operate correctly.
// It has "On" functions and a data type that comprises keys and values that may be strings, interfaces, or anything else.
// While this may seem to be a constraint on the execution of your approach, you may use the OnUnrecognized function to implement anything at an experimental stage.
