//The code is very simple; it's mostly straightforward concurrency control (use sync.Mutex for resource access),
//error handling, and logging. A strategy is composed of two components: TickerStrategy and the BalancesStrategy itself.

//First, the TickerStrategy is initialised to wait for `refreshRate` minutes before triggering an event on its own.
//Define the tick function defined on the TickerStrategy to do the refreshing of the account balances after `refreshRate`
//minutes, and hook this to its own ticker's `Tick()` method. All ExchangeExchange could do is initiate an event for an exchange.
//All other logic around fetching balance info prior to ticker had to be handled by BalancesUpdateTicker.

//The ticker triggered event will now be handled by the BalancesStrategy. First, create an empty ExchangeHoldings instance
//and load the individual account balances for each asset type the particular exchange supports. Populating the
//ExchangeHoldings instance can be done concurrently by fetching info for each asset type concurrently. Reject any empty
//results.

// BalancesStrategy struct maps exchange names as keys to their respective exchange holdings as values.
// Using this strategy, we subscribe to a user defined number of tickers and use those to update our holdings.
// We then atomically update the exchange holding map in our balance strategy struct, and we can read an `ExchangeHoldings` object at any point.
// Note that  this strategy does not order, so stops and take profits can't be engaged. To use it, initialize an exchange and a builder and then simply
