// This code will consist of a single RootStrategy data structure. This data structure would be the only one where Strategy Implementations are held.
// A new RootStrategy object is created. This data structure will be passed down to the last implementation of Strategy.
// After the Strategy Implementations are imported, the order are respective are important.
// The order of import Strategy implementations is important because classes that depend on other classes don't rely on the root strategy in order to work
// so in order to have a non-circular dependency, the classes should be called in a specific order.

// Adding a new strategy is going to be returning two things. The RootStrategy itself, and a specific Strategy that is the type of the Strategy that was requested.
// The ability to add a strategy will create a Map, Map[string] full of RootStrategies. When the end user adds a new strategy, they can give it a unique identifier
// and when they do, we will add a new value to the map. Second, we have a function after the line where a new RootStrategy object is defined; a function called Get
// which takes a string. To get a strategy from a Root Strategy, we simply use this function. We check if the given string matches the String identifier in the Map
// returning the corresponding value in the map. Let's assume similarity with an exchange. Anytime a strategy needs to do something, it will do so through the Dealer,
// which is passing necessary information. Just looking at this graph without talking about the internals, it is easy to see how this system can grow.
// Any additional advanced features or algorithms can be added through additional Function calls, without changing the underlying code of the strategies.

// This dynamic initialization system of functionality has several advantages.
// It allows of the base Dealer to be generic and essentially allow for new additional functionality to be added to it at any time by just adding a new package to the folder structure.
// By using this system it is possible to create a fully fledged Exchange or a versatile universal JSON constructor. Neither of the two situations would be possible using a static approach
// as a static approach leads to a lot of increased code duplication and factoring. This allows for ideas and less explainable of the code.

// Each strategy is instantiated as the variable `m`. Then each of the strategies is passed as a function and called. The function has a Void returned Void.
// Each of the strategy will be called and setup inside their `OnInit()` functions and run their OnInit functions, to set themselves up. Next, each of the OnInit functions will pass a selection of code developers can customize, into their OnFunding() implementations.
// We will then iterate over the variable `rootStrategy` and call each one to execute their function, allowing us to customize each strategy individually.
