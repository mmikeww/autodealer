// trade and withdrawal information so we will only add the information there which we are interested in:
// ExchangesResponse is a struct that includes information about the request as well as the response,
// we're only interested in the response hence why we've added resp.
// We've used the Withdrawal struct as that is the response from the exchange (withdraw.ExchangeResponse).
// The Exchange key is the exchange used to make the request.
// The Type key represents the type of information requested in the Call function.
// The DestinationAddress is the address the withdrawal was sent to if the request used the DepositAddress field.
// The Time key is when the request was made and the Err field returns errors if any occurred.
